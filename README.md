# react-course

This is a series of mini projects that I worked on while reading through ReactJS docs/learning React. I built a series of 8 (so far) projects that track my knowledge and progression of React tools, from basic syntax to cards to props to hooks. 

Project 1 is styled with regular CSS, but all projects onwards are styled with TailwindCSS. Each project is stored on a different branch, for the sake of less storage space on my local computer.
